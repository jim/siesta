Siesta: A little REST for your controllers
=================

This plugin provides all the standard REST actions to controllers, eliminating a lot of duplicate code. It also encourages the use of some patterns that I have found emerging in my code.


Example
=======

The simplest use case is like so:

  siesta :resources

or if you're no fun:

  restful_methods_for :resources

  
For more example, check out the specs.
