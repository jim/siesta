Siesta: A little REST for your controllers
=================

This plugin provides all the standard REST actions to controllers. It also encourages the use of some patterns that I have found emerging in my code, such as defining the web-accessibility of model attributes in the controller, which is part of the web layer, and not in the model.

There are several other excellent plugins that provide the same basic functionality (make_resourceful, restful_controller), but I don't really like defining my controller behavior using a DSL or using before/after filters to perform work that really ought to be done in the body of an action method. 

I prefer writing my controllers in Ruby, and using language level mechanisms such as redefining a method and calling super as needed. I find this makes it easier to understand what an action is doing, and also allows for the most flexibility.


Example
=======

The simplest use case is like so:

  siesta :pencils, :actions => :all

or if you're no fun:

  restful_actions_for :pencils, :actions => :all
  
For more examples, check out the specs. They are located in test_app/specs.


Inspiration
===========

Siesta was influenced fairly heavily by Brendan Baldwin's rest_easy (http://github.com/brendan/rest_easy). Siesta was created partially as a personal exercise to force myself to really think about how the ultimate REST controller plugin would behave, at least from my point of view.
